# Dashtoon-Assignment
This is created for the submission of assignment for Dashtoon

Please update the directory for importing the dataset.
The model is built by importing VGG 16 model using transfer learning.
The code is capable of handling multiple content images that are saved in a folder and correspondingly multiple style images saved in another folder.
I have prepared the project in Google Colab and therefore have commented out the portion of code which can be uncommented if desired to use in jupyter notebook.
The code also saves resultant images to output folder.
